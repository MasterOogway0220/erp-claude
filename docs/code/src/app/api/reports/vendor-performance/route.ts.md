# src/app/api/reports/vendor-performance/route.ts

> `/api/reports/vendor-performance` — GET

See [../README.md](../README.md) for this module's shared behaviour, and
[the API pattern](../../README.md) for the conventions every route follows.

## What it does

Operates on `vendorMaster`, `purchaseOrder`, `goodsReceiptNote`, `gRNItem`, `nCR`.

- **GET** — Read

## How it works

- Gated by `checkAccess("reports", "read")`. **Authentication only** — role enforcement is disabled app-wide.
- Company-scoped with `companyFilter(companyId)`.

## Gotchas

- Errors return `error.message`, so thrown text reaches the user's toast.
