# src/app/api/sales-orders/[id]/processing/route.ts

> `/api/sales-orders/[id]/processing` — GET, POST

See [../../README.md](../../README.md) for this module's shared behaviour, and
[the API pattern](../../../README.md) for the conventions every route follows.

## What it does

Operates on `salesOrder`, `salesOrderItem`, `orderProcessingItem`.

- **GET** — Read
- **POST** — Create

## How it works

- Gated by `checkAccess("salesOrder", "read")`, `checkAccess("salesOrder", "write")`. **Authentication only** — role enforcement is disabled app-wide.
- **Not company-scoped.** Either catalogue data (deliberately global) or scoped via a parent record — verify which before changing.

## Gotchas

- `params` is a `Promise` (Next.js 16) and must be awaited.
- Confirm the company-scoping story before reusing this as a template.
- Errors return `error.message`, so thrown text reaches the user's toast.
