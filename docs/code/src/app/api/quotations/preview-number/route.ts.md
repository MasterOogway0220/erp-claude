# src/app/api/quotations/preview-number/route.ts

> `/api/quotations/preview-number` — GET

See [../README.md](../README.md) for this module's shared behaviour, and
[the API pattern](../../README.md) for the conventions every route follows.

## What it does

Operates on `documentSequence`.

- **GET** — Read

## How it works

- Gated by `checkAccess("quotation", "read")`. **Authentication only** — role enforcement is disabled app-wide.
- **Not company-scoped.** Either catalogue data (deliberately global) or scoped via a parent record — verify which before changing.

## Gotchas

- Confirm the company-scoping story before reusing this as a template.
- Errors return `error.message`, so thrown text reaches the user's toast.
