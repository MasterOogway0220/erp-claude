# src/app/api/mtc/certificates/[id]/generate-results/route.ts

> `/api/mtc/certificates/[id]/generate-results` — POST

See [../../../README.md](../../../README.md) for this module's shared behaviour, and
[the API pattern](../../../../README.md) for the conventions every route follows.

## What it does

Operates on `mTCCertificate`.

- **POST** — Create

## How it works

- Gated by `checkAccess("mtc", "write")`. **Authentication only** — role enforcement is disabled app-wide.
- Company-scoped with `companyFilter(companyId)`.
- Writes inside `$transaction`. Item updates follow the delete-and-recreate pattern, so **a field the caller omits is lost**.
- Writes an audit row. Audit failures are swallowed and never block the operation.

## Gotchas

- `params` is a `Promise` (Next.js 16) and must be awaited.
- Errors return `error.message`, so thrown text reaches the user's toast.
