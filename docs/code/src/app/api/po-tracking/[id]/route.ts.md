# src/app/api/po-tracking/[id]/route.ts

> `/api/po-tracking/[id]` — GET

See [../README.md](../README.md) for this module's shared behaviour, and
[the API pattern](../../README.md) for the conventions every route follows.

## What it does

Operates on `salesOrder`.

- **GET** — Read

## How it works

- Gated by `checkAccess("salesOrder", "read")`. **Authentication only** — role enforcement is disabled app-wide.
- Company-scoped with `companyFilter(companyId)`.

## Gotchas

- `params` is a `Promise` (Next.js 16) and must be awaited.
- Errors return `error.message`, so thrown text reaches the user's toast.
